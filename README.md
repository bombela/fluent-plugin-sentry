# fluent-plugin-sentry [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/y-ken/fluent-plugin-sentry.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/y-ken/fluent-plugin-sentry)

## Overview

fluent-plugin-sentry is a fluentd output plugin that sends aggregated errors/exception events to Sentry. Sentry is a event logging and aggregation platform.<br>

Sentry alone does not buffer incoming requests, so if your Sentry instance is under load, Sentry can respond with a 503 Service Unavailable.<br>

fluent-plugin-sentry extends fluent buffered output and enables a fluend user to buffer and flush messages to Sentry with reliable delivery.

## Installation

install with `gem` or td-agent provided command as:

```bash
# for fluentd
$ gem install fluent-plugin-sentry

# for td-agent
$ sudo /usr/lib64/fluent/ruby/bin/fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-sentry

# for td-agent2
$ sudo td-agent-gem install fluent-plugin-sentry
```

## Preparation

create sentry dashboard first. It could start with cost free!!

* Create an account at https://getsentry.com/pricing/

OR

* Launch Sentry at the self manager server with https://github.com/getsentry/sentry

## Usage

```xml
<source>
 @type forward
</source>

<match notify.**>
  @type sentry

  # Set endpoint API URL
  endpoint_url       https://API_KEY:API_PASSWORD@app.getsentry.com/PROJECT_ID

  # Set default events value of 'server_name'
  # To set short hostname, set like below.
  hostname_command   hostname -s

  # rewrite shown tag name for Sentry dashboard
  remove_tag_prefix  notify.
</match>
```

## Parameters

* endpoint_url (Required)<br>
Set to the sentry DSN, as found in the Sentry dashboard.

* default_level<br>
[default] info

If a `level` is not present in the log, `default_level` is assumed.

* default_logger<br>
[default] fluentd

If a `logger` is not present in the log, `default_logger` is assumed.

* hostname_command<br>
[default] hostname
The name of the server reporting the error.

* flush_interval<br>
[default] 0sec

* report_levels
[default] fatal error warning

Only report to Sentry logs with `report_levels`.

Note that the default ignores `info` and `debug` logs. And `default_level`
defaults to `info`. This might ignore more logs than you anticipated.

* tags_key
[default] ""

Report those items with the given key as tags to Sentry. This makes it possible
to correlate events via tags. Access to structured tag is supported, for
example, given the following log:

```
"{ msg: foo k8s: { app: myapp, container: mycontainer } }
``` 
The tag key `k8s.app` will add the tag `k8s.app: myapp` to the Sentry event.

* stacktrace_expand_json_escaping
[default] true

When going trough some JSON formatter stacktraces `\n` and `\t` characters are
often escaped. Meaning you will see `\n` instead of a visible line return for
example and `\t` instead of a visual tabulation.

When true (the default) this option will expand the escaped character into the
original control code. This important for successfully parsing stacktraces.

It also support rewriting Tag with SetTagKeyMixin.

* remove_tag_prefix
* remove_tag_suffix
* add_tag_prefix
* add_tag_suffix
